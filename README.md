# meteor-test

*This repo runs through the Meteor.js tutorial for building a to-do app, as listed [here](https://www.meteor.com/install), and as more or less a duplicate of the tutorial's GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/meteor/simple-todos/).*

To build this project, clone to local:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/AmundsenJunior/meteor-test.git
```

```cd``` into the ```meteor-test/``` directory, and run ```meteor```. This will initialize the project with downloads of ```meteor-tools``` (not included in the repo's ```.meteor/``` directory. Once the downloads are complete, meteor will start running its server on http://localhost:3000/.
