# meteor-test

*This repo runs through the Meteor.js tutorial for building a to-do app, as listed [here](https://www.meteor.com/install), and as more or less a duplicate of the tutorial's GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/meteor/simple-todos/).*

### .gitignore
The .meteor application files directory is kept out of this repo. It generates upon running Step 1 of the process, ```$ meteor create simple-todos```.
